# Romazava
This is a simple funny cli (command line interface). The purpose of this project is just to generate random value from your terminal.

For example, you can generate a random number between 1 and 100, or a random string, or a random boolean value.

## History

Romazava is a Malagasy word which doesn't means "random" anymore, it's a name of a rice accompaniment. But it's a funny word, so I decided to use it for this project.
If we describe the word "Romazava" in English, it will be something like simple but everybody likes it. (I think :D)
For intimates, there is a song of the Malagasy singer [BIG MJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYzLcOqjJnM) called "Romazava Dadiko".

## Usage
